Computer-Vision GitHub Repository Overview

📌 Repository Information:

Repository Name: Computer-Vision

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools Used: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, Matplotlib


📂 Repository Structure & Project Details

This repository consists of multiple projects focused on computer vision applications using Python. Each project leverages machine learning and image processing techniques with libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe. Below is a detailed breakdown of the projects included:

1️⃣ Face Recognition

📂 Folder: Face Recognition

📌 Description:

This project focuses on detecting and recognizing faces in images or real-time video streams. It likely uses OpenCV's Haar cascades, deep learning models, or Dlib’s face recognition framework to identify faces.

📌 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python – Primary programming language

OpenCV – For face detection and image processing

Dlib – Face landmark detection

Deep Learning Models – Pre-trained models for face recognition

📌 Features:

✔ Detects faces in images and video streams

✔ Identifies and labels recognized faces

✔ Real-time face recognition using a webcam


📌 Possible Enhancements:

Add deep learning models like FaceNet for better accuracy
Implement emotion recognition alongside face recognition

2️⃣ Hand Gesture Volume Control

📂 Folder: Hand Gesture Volume Control

📌 Description:

This project utilizes hand tracking and gesture recognition to control system volume using finger movements. MediaPipe is used for hand detection, and the volume level is adjusted based on the distance between fingers.

📌 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python – Primary programming language

MediaPipe – Hand tracking and gesture recognition

OpenCV – For real-time video processing

PyCaw – Audio control library for adjusting system volume

📌 Features:

✔ Tracks hand movements using MediaPipe Hands API

✔ Measures the distance between thumb and index finger

✔ Maps hand gestures to volume control

📌 Possible Enhancements:

Add multi-hand tracking support
Implement gesture-based mouse control

3️⃣ Image Processing

📂 Folder: Image Processing

📌 Description:

This project demonstrates basic and advanced image processing techniques using OpenCV. It includes color transformations, edge detection, and image enhancement methods.

📌 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python – Primary programming language

OpenCV – For image processing operations

NumPy – For handling image arrays

Matplotlib – For image visualization

📌 Features:

✔ Convert images to grayscale and apply filters

✔ Perform edge detection using Canny and Sobel filters

✔ Adjust brightness, contrast, and apply transformations


📌 Possible Enhancements:

Implement object segmentation
Add image noise removal techniques

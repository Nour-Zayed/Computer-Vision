# Computer-Vision

# Computer Vision Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects that demonstrate the power of image processing, hand tracking, and gesture-based controls. The projects leverage Python libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to solve real-world problems and provide innovative solutions.

## 🔍 Projects Included
**Hand Gesture Volume Control:**

A gesture-controlled system that dynamically adjusts the system volume based on the distance between thumb and index finger.
Combines real-time hand tracking with intuitive controls for a hands-free experience.

**Image Processing:**

A collection of image processing techniques for various use cases, including object detection, edge detection, and more.
Useful for building foundations in computer vision and image manipulation.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (Image Processing)
MediaPipe (Hand Tracking)
PyAutoGUI (Simulating System Interactions)

## 🌟 Repository Highlights
